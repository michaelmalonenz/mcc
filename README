How to get started:
As much new code as possible should have an automated test to show it working.  As this is supposed to be a compiler, that means almost all of this code is readily testable.  Please do that.

I have been building it up from the base to be a really decent lexer, then pre-processor and eventually a parser, linker and emmitter.  Maybe even an optimiser at some point!  However, this is not really working for me.  The next step, I think, is to get the minimum workable slice into a program.  That probably means being able to turn

void main(void)
{
    return 0;
}

into a correct binary, then bolting pieces onto that in order to eventually have a self-hosted compiler.  C99 is the standard I am working towards.  I have no plans to write a standard library to distribute with this compiler, but if you wish to do so, please feel free.  Linux is my operating system of choice.
