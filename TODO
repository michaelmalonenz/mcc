Misc:
Should I be tokenising before I get to the preprocessor?
write a ruby script to replace all tri-graphs in c code OR
add in a compile-time switched ability to handle tri-graphs (so I can eventually claim full c99 compliance)
options
run the unit tests under valgrind
Use stopper for the unit tests??
As soon as possible, start eating my own dog food -> alongside gcc?

Preprocessor:
make it run under valgrind again - it currently leaks like a sieve (Less so now!)
Fix the /**/ style comments to allow for more than one set per line (I don't want to sink to GOTO statements!)
macro replacement
tokenise expressions - should this be passed off to the tokeniser?  The rules are slightly different...
evaluate macro expressions (like #if etc)
support function macros

Tokeniser:
break a string into consecutive tokens

Parser:
Assert that the input file conforms to the c(99) standard

Assembler/linker - (Do I actually want to write this myself or should I attempt to write object files which are compatible with binutils' linker and use that?)
Do I want to distribute a C library (like uClibc or Newlib etc) with this?
