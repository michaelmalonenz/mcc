Misc:
write a ruby script to replace all tri-graphs in c code OR
add in a compile-time switched ability to handle tri-graphs (so I can eventually claim full c99 compliance)
options
Change the error to a more sane thing, marking the failure, then synchronising and carrying on,
instead of exiting completely
Refactor the file operations to be less complicated and appending.  Probably read the whole file using the seek
trick to figure out the space required.  That should allow me to pass a string to the preprocessor,
instead of a file?  #includes become tricky.

Preprocessor:
Replace macros when defining macros
Need to handle the # operator - add to the function rescan
Need to handle #pragma (and figure out what to do with it)

Tokeniser:
Need to figure out the difference between unary and binary operators - general solution.

Parser:
Assert that the input file conforms to the c(99) standard
create an AST
walk the tree
output an intermediate representation (LLVM)
