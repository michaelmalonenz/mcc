Misc:
write a ruby script to replace all tri-graphs in c code OR
add in a compile-time switched ability to handle tri-graphs (so I can eventually claim full c99 compliance)
options
See if I can unit test for an assertion being hit (hopefully without the complcated jmpbuf thingy at work)

Config:
Start adding some more options and potentially make (with some macro magic?)
a better way to add new options

Preprocessor:
Replace macros when defining macros
support function macros - variadic function macros
Need to handle the # operator - add to the function rescan
Need to handle #pragma (and figure out what to do with it)

Tokeniser:
Need to figure out the difference between unary and binary operators - general solution.

Parser:
Assert that the input file conforms to the c(99) standard
create an AST
walk the tree
output an intermediate representation (LLVM)
