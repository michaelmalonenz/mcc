Misc:
write a ruby script to replace all tri-graphs in c code OR
add in a compile-time switched ability to handle tri-graphs (so I can eventually claim full c99 compliance)
options
Use stopper for the unit tests??
As soon as possible, start eating my own dog food -> alongside gcc?

Unit Tests I really should write:
test_Tokeniser //extend and make more complex situations
test_Macros // I still need to write a test which deletes a macro in the middle of the tree somewhere 
            // and maintains the integrity.  Perhaps I should write a function that asserts the invariant.
test_Preprocessor

Should I also write some overall tests for the preprocessor section?

Preprocessor:
Change to use the stream of tokens, instead of parsing the thing in place
fix ifndef to work correctly
  - remove the file-scoped variables to handle conditionals (put them on the stack, for recursive goodness)
  - add in the "skip" variable to the logic deciding whether or not to ignore the conditional portion
change the macro definitions to be a hash table?  It seems unnecessarily limiting to do it this way.
Fix the b-tree after a macro deletion
Fix the /**/ style comments to allow for more than one set per line 
  - I don't want to sink to GOTO statements!
  - might need to rework the algorithm entirely??
  - Also need to allow for // style comments to come after a /**/ comment on a line
macro replacement
evaluate macro expressions (like #if etc)
support function macros
Need to handle the ## operator

Tokeniser:
Need to correct the handle_string_char_const to parse strings and char const properly for literal integer escape sequences.
Write a test for the tokeniser and fix the tokeniser
handle hex constant character escape sequences.
handle constant numbers better (floating point, decimal, octal and hex!)

Parser:
Assert that the input file conforms to the c(99) standard
create an AST
walk the tree

Assembler
output ELF files and DWARF (4?)

linker - (Do I actually want to write this myself or should I attempt to write object files which are compatible with binutils' linker/gold and use that?)
Do I want to distribute a C library (like uClibc or Newlib etc) with this? probably.
