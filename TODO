Misc:
Should I be tokenising before I get to the preprocessor?
unit test the file stuff??  - is it possible to write a test that does this?
write a ruby script to replace all tri-graphs in c code
convert building to use a Makefile?
options
Make the builder more betterer
Fix unit test linkage
run the unit tests automagically
run the unit tests under valgrind
Use stopper for the unit tests??
As soon as possible, start eating my own dog food -> alongside gcc?

Preprocessor:
macro replacement
tokenise directives - should this be passed off to the tokeniser?  The rules are slightly different...
evaluate macros (like #if etc)
support function macros

Tokeniser:
break a string into consecutive tokens

Parser:
Assert that the input file conforms to the c(99) standard

Assembler/linker - (Do I actually want to write this myself or should I attempt to write object files which are compatible with binutils' linker and use that?)
Do I want to distribute a C library (like uClibc or Newlib etc) with this?
