Misc:
unit test the file stuff??  - is it possible to write a test that does this?
Add support for tri-graphs? (Does this need to happen before or after the preprocessing step?)
add support for comments    (                         ---- " ----                            )
options

Preprocessor:
macro replacement
tokenise directives - should this be passed off to the tokeniser?  The rules are slightly different...
evaluate macros (like #if etc)
support function macros

Tokeniser:
break a string into consecutive tokens

Parser:
Assert that the input file conforms to the c(99) standard

Assembler/linker - (Do I actually want to write this myself or should I attempt to write object files which are compatible with binutils' linker and use that?)
Do I want to distribute a C library (like uClibc or Newlib etc) with this?
